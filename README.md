# next-orangews - Stories from an orange news site

This simple project queries stories from Hackernews API and displays
them on a pretty list (for some definition of pretty).

The purpose of this exercise is to gain familiarity with Next.js,
TypeScript and recent additions to React.

Use `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
